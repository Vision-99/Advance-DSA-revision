/*
Approach
The approach is based on the observation that every time 4 pencils are used, they can be recycled into 1 new pencil. This reduces the problem size by 3 (since 4 pencils are consumed, and 1 new pencil is created). The recursion handles the remaining pencils after each recycling step. The base case is when fewer than 4 pencils are left, and each can be used fully without further recycling.

Recursive Relation:

Base Case: If n < 4, the total kilometers written is 4n (each pencil writes 4 km).

Recursive Case: If n >= 4, using 4 pencils generates 16 km (4 pencils Ã— 4 km each). This leaves n - 3 pencils (since 4 are used and 1 is created from recycling). Thus, the total kilometers are 16 + count(n - 3).
